Para Dubitator quien parecía tener las ideas claras, en el comentario que hizo al post [Inside Job](http://juan.urrutiaelejalde.org/inside-job), ahí van unos parrafitos, los tres últimos, de un [post de Brad de Long:](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/05/how-will-economics-respond-to-its-crisis.html)

> **Perhaps** I am missing what is really going on. Perhaps economics departments are reorienting themselves after the Great Recession in a way similar to how they reoriented themselves in a monetarist direction after the inflation of the 1970’s. But if I am missing some big change that is taking place, I would like somebody to show it to me.

> **Perhaps** academic economics departments will lose mindshare and influence to others – from business schools and public-policy programs to political science, psychology, and sociology departments. As university chancellors and students demand relevance and utility, perhaps these colleagues will take over teaching how the economy works and leave academic economists in a rump discipline that merely teaches the theory of logical choice.

> Or **perhaps** economics will remain a discipline that forgets most of what it once knew and allows itself to be continually distracted, confused, and in denial. If that were that to happen, we would all be worse off.

Pues eso, aunque ya sé que se puede dientir, y con alguna razón, de esta opinión.
