[Tony Lawson](http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/faculty/lawson/) is an unorthodox economist affliated to Cambridge University. Somebody who has spent an enormous amount otf time and effort in critisicing the way mainstrean Economics unfolds and trying to characterize the way a really scientific Economics might be developed. He visited us this week and gave a couple of seminars at the UAM.

I found some of his ideas challenging and I think it is worthwhile to ruminate them. I will do that in my own benefit in three parts beyond this introduction.

As an intoductory remark let me just say that Lawson claims to be a methodological pluralist as I said in a previous post that intended to be nothing but a pun. However he declares himself a realist ( so opposing any kind of postmodernism) and more specifically a trascendental realist. That is, he claims to be somebody who not only accepts the existance of an undeniable reality out there, generally described as a set of regularities, but also really wants to find the deep causes of this observable regularities

In the next post I will try to render his uprisal of the present state of mainstream Economics.
